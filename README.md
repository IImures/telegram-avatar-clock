## Steps to Get API ID and API Hash

1. First, you need to have a Telegram account. If you don't have one, you can create it [here](https://telegram.org).
2. Next, go to the [Telegram API website](https://my.telegram.org/auth) and login using your Telegram account credentials.
2. Once you are logged in, you will see a page with a list of API tools. Select the 'API development tools' option.
4. On the next page, you will see a form where you can create a new application. Fill in the form with the following information:
* App api_id - That is what we are looking for
* App api_hash - That is what we are looking for
* App Title: The name of your application.
* Short name: A short name for your application (must be unique).
After filling out the form, click on the Create application button. You will be redirected to a new page that displays your API ID and API hash.
You can now use the API ID and API hash to authenticate your Telegram API requests.
